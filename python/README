To create pkg database (based on filelist), do:

	./create-pkgdb.py

To create spec database (based on SPEC files), do:

Then the different scripts will work using these.

	./print-info.py		Statistical information
	./print-missing.py	List missing packages (eg. between dag and dries)
	./print-obsolete.py	List obsolete packages
	./create-htmldir.py	Generate HTML directory
